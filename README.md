### RESTful/RSS-Integrated Scores &amp; Roster Management for US K–12 Schools
> Developed custom web applications to manage athletic scores, team
            rosters, and event schedules for K–12 schools in the U.S. Integrated
            RSS feeds and RESTful APIs to automate data publishing and sync with
            external platforms. The solution supported coaches, administrators,
            and parents by providing real-time updates and centralized access to
            team information. Successfully deployed over 500 team sites across
            multiple schools, enhancing school-community engagement and
            operational efficiency.
